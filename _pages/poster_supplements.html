<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<img src="/eda1.png" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align: center;">Analysis began by segmenting the data. We chose MTF location after ranking MTF’s by number of cases. After selecting the top 5 locations with the most amount of cases, we analyzed their variation in timeliness. Ft. Hood showed the least amount of variation and was selected as the basis for our analysis.</p>

<h1>Least-Squares Anomaly Detection (LSAD)</h1>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align: center;">LSAD (figure on the right) models as a classification problem. It defines an inlier class as the mean of the process and finds the conditional probability of an observation being a member of this class. The complement is the Anomaly Score and scores close to 1.0 signals anomalous behavior.</p>

<h1>Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)</h1>
<img src="/db.png" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
<p style="font-size:14px; text-align: center;">DBSCAN detects clusters based on an epsilon distance measure between points and a minimum cluster size to identify points outside of clusters as noise which are considered to be anomalous. This DBSCAN identifies points that fall outside a specified cluster. Although some points initially appear as anomalous (Jan. 2018 and Jan. 2019), the peaks have a recurring pattern and therefore fall within the identified cluster.</p>
