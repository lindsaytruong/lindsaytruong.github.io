<p style="font-size:12px; text-align: center;">Analysis began by segmenting the data. We chose MTF location after ranking MTFâ€™s by number of cases. After selecting the top 5 locations with the most amount of cases, we analyzed their variation in timeliness. Ft. Hood showed the least amount of variation and was selected as the basis for our analysis.</p>

<h1>Least-Squares Anomaly Detection</h1>
<p style="font-size:12px; text-align: center;"></p>LSAD models as a classification problem. It defines an inlier class as the mean of the process and finds the conditional probability of an observation being a member of this class. The complement is the Anomaly Score and scores close to 1.0 signals anomalous behavior.</p>
